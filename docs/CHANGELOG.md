## [1.6.5] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **DoH Fallback** - Uses DNS over HTTPS (Cloudflare, Google) when regular DNS fails, bypassing VPN DNS hijacking
- **getaddrinfo Timeout** - 3 second timeout prevents hanging on unresponsive system resolver

## [1.6.4] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **DNS Retry Logic** - Retries DNS resolution once (300ms delay) before giving up
- **System Resolver Fallback** - Uses macOS getaddrinfo() as last resort when dig fails

## [1.6.3] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **Light Mode Dropdown Visibility** - Background colors now visible in both light and dark modes
- **Hosts File Fallback** - Uses disk cache for hosts file entries when DNS fails at startup

## [1.6.2] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Remove Stale IPs on Refresh** - Auto DNS refresh now removes IPs that are no longer resolved (was only adding, never removing)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Deduplicate Routes** - Multiple domains resolving to the same IP no longer create duplicate routes

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- **Instant Startup** - If DNS cache exists, applies routes immediately (~2-3s) then refreshes DNS in background
- **DNS Disk Cache** - Resolved IPs are saved to disk and used as fallback when DNS fails
- **Faster Service Toggle** - Enabling a service now resolves all domains in parallel + batch route addition

### Changed
- **Smarter DNS Timeouts** - Local DNS (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x): 1s timeout; External DNS: 1.5s timeout
- DNS cache stored at `~/Library/Application Support/VPNBypass/dns-cache.json`

## [1.5.5] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- Removed debug logging code from 1.5.4

## [1.5.3] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Prevent Double Route Application** - Added guard to skip duplicate route application within 5 seconds
- **Fixed Invalid Default Domains** - Removed non-resolving domains: `twimg.com` → `pbs.twimg.com`, `cdninstagram.com` → `scontent.cdninstagram.com`, `api.signal.org` → `chat.signal.org`

### Changed
- **Faster DNS Timeouts** - Reduced DNS timeout from 4s to 2s (1s dig timeout)
- **Larger Batch Size** - Increased from 50 to 100 domains per parallel batch
- **Faster DoH/DoT** - Reduced timeout from 5s to 3s

## [1.5.2] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **True Parallel DNS** - Fixed thread blocking in DNS resolution (was using sync calls that blocked cooperative threads)
- **Auto-Update Helper** - App now detects helper version mismatch and auto-updates (was only installing on first launch)

### Changed
- DNS resolution now uses `DispatchQueue.global()` for true GCD parallelism

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed
- **Massive Performance Improvement** - Route application reduced from 3-5 minutes to ~10 seconds
- **True Parallel DNS Resolution** - Fixed `@MainActor` serialization that was blocking parallel execution
- **Batch Route Operations** - Routes now added/removed via single XPC call instead of 300+ individual calls
- **DNS Cache for Hosts File** - Eliminated duplicate DNS resolution (was resolving all domains twice)
- **Increased DNS Batch Size** - From 5 to 50 domains per parallel batch

### Changed
- Helper version bumped to 1.2.0 (will auto-reinstall on first launch)
- DNS resolution functions now `nonisolated static` for true concurrency

## [1.3.4] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
