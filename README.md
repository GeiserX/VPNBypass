## Why?

Corporate VPNs often route all traffic through the tunnel, which can cause issues:

- **Performance**: Streaming and messaging apps become slow or buffer constantly
- **Broken features**: Chromecast, AirPlay, and location-based features fail
- **Unnecessary load**: Non-business traffic clogs the VPN tunnel
- **Privacy**: Personal services don't need to go through corporate infrastructure

VPN Bypass intelligently routes selected services directly to the internet while keeping business traffic secure through VPN.

## How It Works

1. **VPN Detection**: Monitors network interfaces and running processes to detect VPN type
2. **Gateway Detection**: Identifies your local gateway (Wi-Fi/Ethernet router)
3. **Route Management**: Adds host routes to send specific traffic through local gateway instead of VPN
4. **Route Verification**: Optionally pings routes to verify they're working
5. **DNS Bypass**: Optionally adds entries to `/etc/hosts` to bypass VPN DNS

### VPN Detection Logic

The app intelligently detects corporate VPNs while avoiding false positives:

| Interface Type | IP Range | Detection |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| **Corporate VPN** (GlobalProtect, Cisco, etc.) | `10.x.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x` | ✅ Detected as VPN |
| **Cloudflare WARP** | `100.96-111.x.x` | ✅ Detected as VPN |
| **Tailscale** (mesh networking) | `100.64-127.x.x` | ❌ Not detected* |
| **Tailscale** (exit node active) | `100.64-127.x.x` | ✅ Detected as VPN |

**\*Tailscale in normal mode** only routes traffic to other Tailscale devices. It's not a "full VPN" because your regular internet traffic still goes through your normal connection. The app only considers Tailscale as a VPN when you're using an **exit node** (routing all traffic through another Tailscale device).

The detection also requires:
- The interface must have the `UP` flag (actually connected, not just configured)
- The interface must have an IPv4 address in a VPN range

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Admin privileges (for route management and hosts file)

## Permissions

The app requires:
- **Network access**: To detect VPN connections and resolve domains
- **Admin privileges**: To add routes and modify `/etc/hosts` (prompted when needed)
- **Notifications**: Optional, for VPN status alerts (prompted on first launch)

## Troubleshooting

### Routes not being applied

1. Check if VPN is actually connected (look for utun interface)
2. Verify local gateway is detected in Settings → General
3. Check Logs tab for errors
4. Use "Verify Routes" button to test connectivity

### Hosts file not updating

The app will prompt for admin password when modifying `/etc/hosts`. If you deny, disable this feature in Settings → General.

### DNS still going through VPN

Some VPNs force DNS through the tunnel. The hosts file entries help bypass this, but you may also need to:
- Disable "Route all DNS through VPN" in your VPN client
- Use a local DNS resolver

### Route verification failing

If routes are applied but verification fails:
- The destination host may be blocking ping (ICMP)
- Try accessing the service directly - it may still work
- Check if the service is actually accessible from your network
